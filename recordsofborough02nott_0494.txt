14d.)3 1321, ro. for. 5d. Probably

penny: see Riley, immersas, p. 47 5.

ΟΝΥΕΤ, 156. A spice?

ORmNALE, 176. A service-book con-
taining the manner of saying and
solemnizing the divine office. See

ORTE3ERD, 359. An orchard. [AS.
‘orceard3' AEffric, 28, 11: ‘ord-
ceard3’ C.D.‚ iv. 72. See Skeat‚
av. ‘orchard.’]

OVURLETHRE‚ 54. The overleather,
zie„ the welt of a boot or shoe.
[Prompt.‚ p. 373. See especially
Riley, Meum-sals, pp. 572-3.]

lattices was occasionally called a
‘parclose.' See Prompt.‚ p. 382 n. 3.

Pmmoxm, Punoozxmn, 270. A
vendor of pardons and indulgences
from the Pope. Chaucer’s descrip-
tion of the Pardoner must ever
remain the best. See Prompt.,
p. 383 n. 1.

PEERK, 58. See p. 58 n. 4, where
‘parclose' is suggested. It may
simply mean, however, a ‘perch'
or rail. Cath.‚ p. 276, ‘perke;'
Prompt.‚ p. 393, ‘perche or perke.’
The ‘ee’ of ‘peerk⁷ at p. 58 is
probably due to a vicious local pro-
nunciation: ‘perch' being still fre—
quently pronounced in Nottingham
as though spelt ‘ peerch.’

menemm, 322. A painted eloth,
no doubt identical with ‘stained
cloth‚' a cloth embroidered or
worked in colours, a piece of
tapestry. See Cath.‚ p. 363 n. 4.
