for that keeping they should receive tonnage, poundage, and a fourth
part of the subsidy of wool and woolfells,1 as is more fully contained
in certain letters patent on behalf of our Lord the King therein to
you directed‚2 which tonnage, poundage, and fourth part aforesaid
at present is not collected nor held in hand: wherefore Ι command
you on behalf of our Lord the King, most strongly beseeching you
for my own part, that, having called before you both the merchants
of the said town as well as others whom it shall seem to be more
expedient to call for diligently executing the custody aforesaid,
you do with fitting haste provide two hundred pounds, trans-
mitting the said money by such persons from whom you may have
without delay sufficient security for the repayment of the money
aforesaid to us so delivered; considering particularly the peril and
wrath of our Lord the King, and the injury of the whole kingdom
aforesaid, if the aforesaid keeping of the sea should be at this time
through your default in any wise brought to nought or hindered—
which God forbid l—certifying me distinctly hereupon by your re-
sponsive letters as to the premises by the bearer of these presents
by your letters.

Given at Kingston upon Hull, under the seal of the office of
