‘braendejern.'] It is doubtful if .
there was any distinction between
the meaning of ‘andiron,' ‘brand-
iron‚' and ‘brandreth,' although it
is noticeable that ‘andiron’ and
‘brandiron' are generally repre-
sented by undena, whilst ‘brand-
reth’ is rendered tapes. Baret even
renders ‘brandiron' by clzylra (=
χύτρα). In Danish ‘braendejern'
means a branding-iron, like the ³
Germ. ‘brandeisen.'
BRASER, 86, a brasier.
BRAVIARE, 134, to contend for a ³
prize, to game. [Evidently from
‘bravium,⁷ the medieval form of
‘ bratheum ² = βραβεῖον.]
BREASTPLATES, closed, 18. This pro-
bably means a breastplate and a

backplate.
BREEK, 86.

‘broc3' but ‘j. breek' is here re-

ferred to, immediately after the Ἰ

mention of a pair of breeches.

‘Breech' (=AS. ‘brec⁷) was used ¹

as the plural 3 see Skeat, s.v..· but
still the expression ‘ j. breek' ap-
pears strange. Can it mean some-

thing like ‘breeching,' ‘breech-
band ?'

BRENWOD, 86. Firewood. [Scotch
‘ branewod 3' Jamieson: Germ.

‘ brennholtz.']

BRUCETUM, 342. A small wood:
here the Coppice of Nottingham is
referred to. [O.Fr. ‘brocete;⁷
Godefroy, i. 7 37.]

BULKER, 250. This is clearly the
name of a trade. A.D. 1414-15,

‘Breek' is really the ¹
plural ‘bre'c,' breeclzes, of the AS. ι

a nightwalker, one who sleeps under
a bench,⁷ but this can hardly be the
meaning here. It may possibly be
connected with the verb ‘bowk,'
‘buck,’ to cleanse or whiten clothes
with the lye known as ‘ buck.' [See
Cath.‚ p. 38, ‘bowkynge;⁷ Jamie-
son, ‘bouk;⁷ and see Skeat sa).
‘buck' Cf. old Germ. ‘baucherin‚'
latram· Grimm, W‘irterb.‚ vol. i.
col. 1166. Godefroy gives, i. 670,
without explanation, the word
‘bocheur,' which appears to mean
one that ‘bowks' or ‘ bucks.']

Bvo, 356, 359, 361, to build. [O.N.
‘byggjaj Dan. ‘byggeg' Swed.
‘braga-³]

CAM, 20. A cam of a loom.

CAMINUS, 54, 86, 140. This word in
the Middle Age-s was used generally
to mean a movable iron grate or
stove, an interpretation borne out
by representations of kitchens in
MSS, see Parker, Dom. Archia,
i. 14. Similarly ‘kamin' in Danish
means a fireplace3 but in German
it is applied to the chimney as well.
See further upon this subject the
quotations in Cath.‚ p. 63 n. 33 and
the Prompt.‚ p. 169 n. 23 and the
citations in Lib. Alb„ ii. 303, Μ’.
‘chymene.' There is a ‘caminus'
of plaster mentioned in A.D. 1235-
36 , Parker, Dem. Ambit„ i. 84: this
must mean a chimney in the modern
sense. In A. D. 1430 there is action
sor 4s. 10d. ‘pro uno camino igneu’
(sic), which can only mean a fire-
grate3 1321,ro. for. 17d. A.D. 1407,
Richard Mason sues for making a
stone ‘caminus ⁷ at Bingham 3 1304,
ro. for. 2: this is clearly a stone
chimney.
