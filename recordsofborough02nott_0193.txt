so that her life was despaired of, and other injurios did to her; to
the grievous damage of the aforesaid John Gilbert and Joan his wife,
and against the peace of our Lord the King aforesaid: whereby they
say that they are injured and have damage to the value of loos.;
and therefore they bring suit. And the aforesaid john Malefield
comes in his own proper person, and as to the coming with force and
arms, etc„ and whatsoever, etc.,2 he says that he is thereof in nowise
guilty3 and as to the remainder of the trespass aforesaid, the same
John Malefield says that the aforesaid John Gilbert and Joan his
wife ought not to have an action against him, because he says that
the aforesaid Joan together with one Margery her daughter with
abusive and quarrelsome words, at Lenton without the liberty of the
town of Nottingham, in the house of one Robert Daniel, made an
assault upon him, John Malefield, and called him ‘false thief,' and
continued the same assault thence to the place where the trespass
aforesaid is supposed3 to have been committed, and the aforesaid
Joan, taking the said john Malefield by the neck, threw him on
the ground; and the damage that the same Joan had and received
was of her own proper assault24 all and singular of which the same
John Malefield is ready to verify as the Court, etc.: wherefore he
does not think that any wrong can be assigned against his person;
and he prays judgment, if the aforesaid plaintiffs ought to maintain
their aforesaid action against him. And the aforesaid John Gilbert
and Joan his wife say that they ought not to be excluded from their
aforesaid action for anything before-alleged, because they say, that
the damage that the same Joan had was of the wrong6 and assault
of the said John Malefield‚ and not of the assault of the said Joan;
and this they seek to verify by the country, etc. To which the same
John Malefield, protesting that he does not acknowledge any of the
things before-alleged by the aforesaid John Gilbert and Joan, says
as he has above pleaded‚ and that the damage that she had was of
the assault and wrong of the aforesaid Joan: all and singular of
which in manner and form aforesaid before-alleged and pleaded he
is ready to verify; wherefore he prays judgment, and that the afore—
said John Gilbert and Joan be precluded from their aforesaid action,
etc.—Judgment is respited until the coming of the Recordcr on
account of the diversity of the plea. 1328, ro. for. 20.
