KARLOMPSTORPHE‚ vol. i. p. 16. The

bounds of Sherwood Forest in

along the Trent to the ‘ancient
course of the Leen, which is be-

meadow of Wssford, thence along
the said ancient course of the Leen
to the meadow called “Carlam‚''
and thence by the common high-
way to the bridge over the Leen
near the orchard of the Priory of
Lenton,' etc, etc.; Deering, p. 311.
Carlam would thus appear to be

‘ Storphe' is evidently a misreading
of Greaves' (probably of h), and
should clearly be read ‘storth.'
