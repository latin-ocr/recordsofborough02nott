Joan Potter, of Nofflngham, by her guardian Geoffrey Baker,
complains of john Lorimer of a plea of trespass: for that he, here
at Nottingham‚ on Sunday next before the feast of the Conception
of the Blessed Mary last past‚1 made an assault upon the said Joan,
and there beat, wounded and evilly treated her, and other injuries did
to her; to the great damage of the said plaintiff of Ioos.; wherefore,
etc. Who comes, and defends, etc.; and he sayS, that the said Joan
is and was the servant of the said John Lorimer, and the said Joan
gave a contrary answer to him, and therefore the said John Lorimer
seized an ell-wand, and struck her upon the head and all over, as
was just. And the aforesaid Joan, by the said Geoffrey and John
Breadsall, her attornies‚ prays judgment of his answer; and the
said John does the like. And so judgment is respited until the next
Court of the said trespass until the arrival of the Mayor and Recorder.

1403-4, January 16.

Judgment is respited of the taxation upon the acknowledgment in
the plea of trespass between Joan Potter‚ plaintiff, and John Lorimer,
defendant, as appears in the sixth roll. And at this Court the afore-
said Joan, plaintiff, has not prosecuted. Therefore she and her
sureties are in mercy.2

And John de Breadsall, attorney of our Lord the King‚ comes,
and demands that the said John Lorimer do satisfy our Lord the
King for the effusion of blood drawn from the said Joan in the
French Borough of the town of Nottingham, for that the said John
Lorimer in full Court has acknowledged the drawing of blood. And
before the Mayor and Recorder it is adjudged for our Lord the Khrg,
that the said John be condemned sor the effusion os blood, notwith-
standing anything before alleged. 1301, ΓΟ. Sd·
