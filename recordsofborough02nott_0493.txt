MANUS, 18, etc. This word (⁶hand')
was very generally used in the
Middle Ages for an oath or a com-
purgator 3 see Duo, sar. ‘jura-
mentum' Hence the phrase
‘vadiare legem se quinta manu,'
ete. (to wage law himself with the
fifth hand) 3 which appears to mean
that he shall swear with the fifth
hand or compurgator. Cf. Laws of
Ethelred, Ι. 6. 1 ξ8, ‘nime him
f 1'f lvegnas to and be'o him sylf syxta
and ladie hine ]2aes,' let him take
to him five thanes and he himself

pp. 8, 85, 94 (the ‘gold' is here
owing to the erroneous identifi-
cation of the first syllable of ‘ort'-
chalcum' with ‘aurum '). See in
this connection the quotation in
Carth„ p. xlviii.‚s.v. ‘laton' slilfric
has also ‘aet-arius, iiiaestlingsiiiif53’

is explained by Duc. as meaning
timber for building, like the classical

beam, prepared timber. Cf. with

32 Ed. Ι., p. 41, that timber is only
‘ mereme’ (= ‘ meremium ⁷) when
it has been felled and chopped or
cut (into shape).
