and Burgcsses have certain ancient evidences advantageous and
pertaining, as they said, to the Community of the same town of
Nottingham, with and whereof it behoves the said Mayor and Bur-
gesses to have credence in divers parts and places far distant, they
are manifoldly afraid and fear for the said original evidences as well
on account 01 the fear of the consumption and loss of the same as on
account of other divers and adverse accidents that may frequently
happen: wherefore it was besought of us with no small impor-
tunity and humbly prayed by the aforesaid Mayor and Burgesses
in the town of Nottingham aforesaid, that we, having considered the
premises, would undertake to inspect and examine the said evidences
presented to us, and that, if we should find that the said evidences
were not falsified or suspicious in any part, we would cause the
same to be published and copied, exemplified and reduced to a tran-
script and a public form by the Notary Public aforesaid, and that we
would furthermore deign to ordain and decree that as full faith might
be given everywhere in actions to such transcript reduced to public
form as to the aforesaid original evidences. Of which evidences the
true tenors follow and are as follows:
