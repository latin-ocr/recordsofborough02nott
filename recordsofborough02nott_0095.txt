1408] REcorms or THE Bonotmn or No'r'rffianM. 67

by the surety for prosecuting of Hugh Fox, which John Odynges is
now essoined in the plea aforesaid by Robert Slinger: wherefore day
is given to the party prosecuting at the hour of Prime on XVednesday
next following.

At which day and hour the aforesaid Thomas appears, by John
Jors his attorney, and complains for that the said John Odynges
detains from the aforesaid Thomas nine shillings and threepence of
silver of a rent, which (money) one John de Lichfield, of Nottingham,
at the feast of the Invention of the Holy Cross in this present year,
delivered to the said John Odynges, here at Nottingham, for the
behoof and use of the aforesaid Thomas; which money, although
the said John Odynges was often requested by the said Thomas, the
said John refused to deliver them to him, and unjustly detained,
and still does detain; to the damage of the said Thomas of os. 8d.3
wherefore he brings suit, ete. And the said John Odynges comes;
and he says that he is not bound to answer to the said Thomas in
the plea aforesaid, because the said Thomas lately sued against him
as a Burgess of Nottingham, and riow he sues against him as a non-
Burgess; and therefore he prays judgment. And the aforesaid
Thomas, by his aforesaid attorney, says to this that the said John is
bound to answer to him in this plea, because the said Thomas was
born as a bastard out [of espousals], etc.; and therefore he prays
judgment. And so the Court considered, that the said John shall
answer as to a foreign3 man. And hereupon the said John defends;
and says that he detains nothing from the said Thomas, and that
he has received nothing for the use of the said Thomas as is declared
against him above; and he puts himself upon an inquest. And
therefore it is commanded to the Bailiffs, that they cause an inquest
between them to come, etc. And hereupon the said John Odynges
is essoined, by Roger Bell, until the next Court, etc. i

Thereafter, on XVednesday next before the feast of the Nativity
of the Blessed Mary the Virgin next following,⁴ the said John
Odynges came, and acknowledged the aforesaid debt: whereupon
the damages are taxed at 4d.; and the said John is in mercy.
