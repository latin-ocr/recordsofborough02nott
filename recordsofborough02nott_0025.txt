INTRODUCTION. xix

This drawing was made by a native of Nottingham of whom the
town has every reason to be proud. TIIOMAS SANDBY‚ R.A., was
born at Nottingham in 1721, four years before his more celebrated
brother PAUL SANDffig R.A., who has considerable claims to bc con-
sidered the founder of the English School of &Vater Colour Painting.
Thomas Sandby was a sels-taught artist and invented a system of
perspective that he carried to great perfection. ‘ He went to London
in 1741 and entered the Drawing School at the Tower (the only
approach to a school of art then existing, intended chiefly for military
plan-drawing), and was in 1743 appointed draughtsman to the Chief
Engineer in Scotland. He was thus engaged when the Rebellion of
1745 took place in the Highlands, and he was the first to convey to
the Government the intelligence of the landing of the Pretender.
Appointed Private Secretary and Draughtsman to H.R.H. william,
Duke of Cumberland‚ he was present at the Battle of Culloden in
1746, and subsequently accompanied the Duke in his campaigns
in the Low Countries.’1 Thomas Sandby was busily engaged in
the Committees of Artists that preceded the foundation of the Royal
Academy in 1768. Upon the creation of the Academy he and his
brother Paul were nominated foundation members by George III.
Thomas was elected the first Professor of Architecture at the Royal
Academy, a post that he held until his death. He had been
appointed Deputy-Ranger of XVindsor Great Park in 1746. He
planned all the improvements that were effected in the Park and
Forest from that date until his death, the construction of Virginia
Water, the largest artificial lake in the kingdom, being one of his
works. In his youth Thomas Sandby made several beautiful
drawings of parts of old Nottingham for Deering's Nottz'mglmmz'a
Vetus et Nova. In later life 116 performed the same labour for old
London. Many of his drawings of parts of old London arc pre-

served in the Print Room, British Museum, and at the Soane
