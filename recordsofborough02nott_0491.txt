INHALDER, 252, Inneholder, 391. An j

innholder, innkeeper.

INJURIA, 58, 164. The phrase ‘de
injuria sua propria' is a translation
of the law-phrase ‘de son tort
demesne,’ which is of frequent
occurrence in the Year Books, and,
indeed, in all old law proceedingS.
This was a replication when the
defendant justified the wrong
charged against him by alleging

command or authority from another3 ¹
or by authority at common law, as J
a Constable might justify an arrest ι
(see an instance, vol. i.‚ p. 360); or ξ
by authority of an Act of Pariia-

ment. In the first case the plaintiff
would reply that the defendant had
done the wrong, ‘de son tort de-
mesne, sans ceo, que C. luy com-
mand modo et forma,’ etc.‚ zie„

 

that he had committed the trespass ¹

‘ of his own wrong (or tort), without

C. having commanded him in the ἵ

manner and form,' etc. A similar

replication, denying the defendant’s ἦ

were sometimes inserted in the

plaintifs's declaration, which barred ¹
the necessity for this replication:

see vol. i.‚ pp. 306, 3083 and p. 58
above for instances. The object
of this replication was to fix the

responsibility for the tort or wrong ¹

upon the defendant. Cf. Year
Book, 31 Ed. Ι., p. 379⁷ ‘coe est
vostre tort ' (the tort is your's); and
year Book, 32 Ed. Ι., p. 520, ‘of
his own action and tort.’ In the
French glossary at thc end of

Ducange is cited ‘a vostre tort' as ι
