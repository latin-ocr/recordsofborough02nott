INTRODUCTION. xiii

ΑΒ. 1483-4. These are in quartos containing from 150 to 180 pageS,
carelessly written, with many of the entries unfinished, declarations
omitted, etc. They comprise suits between Burgesses, and Foreign
Suits, the latter preponderating.

4. Very little has been drawn from William Greaves' papers for
this volume: the reason being that most of the original documents of
this period copied out by him still exist, and they have been used
in preference. The papers of William Gregory, on the other hand,
have supplied much more matter than they did to the first volume,
some of it being of the greatest value. Gregory seems to have
been engaged in researehes into the origin of the Town Couneil;
at any rate he has preserved for us a notice, from the lost Red
Book, of the creation of a committee, in A.D. 1446, by the Burgesses
to manage the affairs of the town. Here we have, as he so truly
remarks, ‘the erection and electiori of the Council.’1 It is notice-
able that this Committee, which obtained such great power a few
years afterwards, was not considered as firmly established at the time
of the granting of the ruling charter of Henry VI., ΑΒ. 1448, for no
mention of it is made therein.

5. We now approach a class of records that, by successive stages
and alterations, have developed into the Hall or Council Books.
The first form of these records is the Mayoralty Rolls, two of which
are represented in the first volume of this work. Two of these
Mayoralty Rolls of the period embraced by this volume are pre-
served, viz„ No. 3943, A.D. 1407-8; and No. 3944, A.D. 1414-15.
The first, which has suffered considerably from damp, consists of a
very long roll containing the presentments of affrays and a second
roll, much decayed, giving the Assizes of Bread. Several extracts
have been derived from the Roll sor A.D. 1414-15, which comprises
three rolls, one containing enrolments of Sureties to keep the
Peace3 another the Assizes of Bread ; and the third the presentments
of affrays. On the dorse there is a list of the fines for licence to
traffic and a list of the Burgesses enrolled. Most of these headings

are represented in the extracts from this Roll printed at page 102 sqq.
