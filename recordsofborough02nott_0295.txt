be forwarded, it is meritorious to rnend dangerous roads and perilous
bridges‚ and especially the bridge 01 Hethbeth over the Trent, which
has nothing whereby it may be sustained, except only by gifts of
charity, and in order that every Christian may give more speedily and
freely alms and charitable gifts to the fabric and sustentation of the

upon the said bridge daily eelebrating divine service in honour of our
Saviour and of the Blessed James the Apostle and of All Hallows,
for all the helpers and benefactors of the bridge aforesaid. Further-

constituted our well-beloved in Christ william Thornes and &Villiarn

receive alrns and charitable gifts for the separation, sustentation‚
and mending 01 (116 bridge aforesaid, especially beseeehing and
asking that, if the same william and william, or any other bearer
of the same, corne amongst you in order to ask for such 311115, you
will give to thern, or one of them, gifts such as you are able, and
this more favourably in consideration of our supplication. And in
order that this our present writing may the more readily appear
authentic to you, the seal of the office of the Mayoralty of the town
aforesaid is affixed to these presents.
