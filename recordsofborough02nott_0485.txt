been known as ‘daubing'
use of Fr. ‘torchis' in this sense.

At p. 374 above in two cases this l

daubing was laid upon a framework
of laths‚ and at p. 373 above a
mud-wall is mentioned, which was
clearly tempered with straw. This
word is still applied in dialects to
the building of mud walls: see

DEFENDERE‚ 17, 26, 30, 140, et passim.
In personal actions it was necessary
for the defendant to commence his
answer to the count of the plaintiff
by the denial of the grounds of
action. This was done by the
phrase ‘defendit vim et injuriam

quando, etc.‚' which represents the =

law-French ‘il defend tort et force,
e defendera la ou et quant il
devera‚' lte defends llze tort ( = wrong)
and force, and will defend where
and when lle ought, where ‘defend'
has the old French meaning of

‘deny' This phrase were better

rendered ‘to deny the force and ν
tort or wrong,' as Mr. Horwood has l

done in the Year Books, if it were
not for the fact that, when law pro-
ceedings were ordered to be written
in English, this phrase was uni—
versally translated ‘to defend the
force and injury.' After the words

that the substance of the plaintifs's
declaration or replication should be
recited and defended (denied);

(vol. ii., p. 470). By defending the
force and injury the defendant ex-
cused himself of the wrong (‘in-
juria ²) surmised against him, and
made himself a party to the plea;
by defending the damages he
affirmed that the plaintiff was able
to be answered to; and by the
phrase ‘he will defend where and
when he ought‚' he accepted the
power of the Court to hear and
determine their pleas3 ,Modus
