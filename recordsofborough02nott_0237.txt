HENRY‚ by the grace of God, King of England and France, and
Lord of Ireland, to all his bailiffs and faithful subjects to whom these
present letters may come greeting. Know ye that, not only on
account of the signal merits of our subjects and lieges who have kept

latest times: which sacred footsteps we desiring to follow and pursue

of our lieges and subjects have manifoldly offended in divers parts of
this our realm against God and justice, and against our royal dignity
and authority, and against the tranquility and peace of this our
realm and of the common weal committed to us, in contempt of us
and our laws, many to wit committing enormous and grievous, others
lighter crimes and offences, and that they therefore ought to fear the
scourges of our severity and castigation: We, although we have
deemed that they should be mercifully dealt with on account of their
multitude, have yet decided not to procecd hcreunto with headlong
