An endeavour has, however, been made to restrict these notes
to what was absolutely necessary to the work.

As in the previous volume of this work, the translations
have had the advantage of the supervision of the Rev. Canon
RAINE, D.C.L., and the selection and transcription of the
matter and general editing has been done by Mr. W. H.
STEVENsoN, by whom the notes and glossaries, index, ἃς,
have also been supplied.

ln conclusion, the Town Council have only to reiterate
the hope expressed in the former volume, that this work may
meet with such a reception as will warrant its continuance

and completion.
