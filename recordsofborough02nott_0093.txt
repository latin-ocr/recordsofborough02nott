a plea of tres-pass. And whereupon 116 complains that whereas the
said Margaret was his servant, in the 7th year of the reign of King
Henry that now is, here at NottIngham„ the same Margaret, on
XVednesday next after the feast of Saint Andrew the Apostle,1 in
the same year, ground down and formed divers keys for divers doors
of the aforesaid John here in his dwelling-house at Nottingham‚
and by means of one key of the said keys she opened the door of
his wine 1316111, and took out unjustly and distributed amongst her
neighbours, without the knowledge 01 1116 said John, thirty gallons of
wine; to the damage of the said John of 4os.; wherefore 116 brings
suit. And the aforesaid Margaret 6011165, and defends the words of
the Court‚ etc.; and says that 5116 15 1101, 1101 ever was, guilty 01 1116
trespass aforesaid; and this she prays may be inquircd of. Therefore
it 15 commanded to the Bailiffs, that they cause an inquest between
them to come against wednesday next before the feast of Saint
Dunstan next to come.

On which day it is found by 1116116 jurors faithfully elected, tried
and sworn as to the promises, that the aforesaid Margaret is not
guilty of the aforesaid trespass. Therefore it is considered by the

he be in mercy; and that the aforesaid John Pope and Margaret his

wife shall go quit without day. 1304, ro. for. 3.
