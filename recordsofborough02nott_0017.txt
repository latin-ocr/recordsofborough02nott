volume. Their introduction has disturbed the strict chronological
order observed in the extracts in the first volume, for it has been
found necessary to relegate them to a separate section, inasmuch
as they do not require a translation to face them in the same manner
as the extracts in Latin. Many objections, it is true, may be urged
against this dislocation, but this system seems to be the most con-
venient one to adopt in a work like the present, for these documents
required a different system of editing from the Latin extracts.
There are many phrases, words and orthographies in these English
documents that can only be understood by students of the language
of this period, and it has, therefore, been necessary, in order to
render easy the perusal of these records by the general reader,
to explain such phraseS, etc., as they occur. This has been done by
means of footnotes wherein the word or phrase to be explained is
repeated for convenience of cross-reference.

3. The Records of the Borough Court have supplied the greater
part of the matter for this volume, as they did for the first. The
contents of these Rolls vary very much, those for the early part of
the period being full of matter ; sinking down to the barest possible
entries in the reign of Henry V.; in A.D. 1429 again becoming very
full, the entries being then as much extended as they were previously
condensed. This fulness continues throughout the Rolls until we
approach the end of the series, when many of them are mutilated.
The variation in the way of keeping these Rolls is generally identical
with a change of hand, so that the meagreness or fulness of the
entries may be explained by the apathy or zeal of the clerk that
kept them. From Nos. 1307 to 1319 the Rolls for each year are
divided into two parts, here represented by different numbers, the
division being from roll 1 to 14, and from 15 to 26 inclusive. Many
of the Rolls have only one of the two parts preserved, so that
many of the years are imperfect, rendering it impossible to trace
out the result of a suit. A remarkable disserence between the Rolls
os this period and those of the period of volume I. is to be found
in the vast number of foreign suits (Placilcz l‹'0m'nsc‹2z). or suit>-
