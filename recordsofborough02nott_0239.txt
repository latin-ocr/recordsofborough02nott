of such our remission and pardon until thc advent of the holy day of
Good Friday, to wit, the sevcnth day of April last past, so that wc
might bestow the bounty of our remission and indulgence upon the

other names they may be known, all manner of trespasses, offences,
misprisions, contempts and impeachments made or done by the same
Mayor and Burgesses before the said day of Good Friday against the
form of the Statutes of Liveries of Cloths and HoodS, wherefore
punishment should be by fine or ransom, or by other pecuniary
penalties‚ or imprisonments, the Statutes aforesaid notwithstanding.

And furthermore, of our motion and knowledge aforesaid, we have
pardoned‚ remitted and released to the same Mayor and Burgesses
