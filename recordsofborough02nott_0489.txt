appears to be the Fr. ‘fond‚' ex-
plained by Cotgrave as ‘a bottom‚
floore, ground, foundation, etc.; a
plot, ον piece (fgrounds Cf. Scotch
‘found3’ Jamieson. Hence ‘grese-
font’ probably means ‘grassplot'

ἓ 5. See Expeditatio, above. In
g 12, however, Manwood identifies
‘hamling’ or ‘hambling' with the

Laws, c. 32, which he says was ‘a
kind of cutting or laming of dogges
in the hammes‚' sometimes called

is, ‘houghing’ (see Skeat, av.
‘hough⁷)‚ cutting the ‘hough-
sinew.' [The verb ‘hamelian,' 2‘0
mutilate, occurs in the AS. Chron.,
A.D. 1036. This seems to be the
only instance in AS„ and the word
appears to be clearly of Scandi-
navian origin. O.N. ‘hamla‚' to
maim, mulz'lale‚ Dan. ‘hamblae.'

HAWKYN’, 162. This word appears
to mean ‘hawking,’ carrying about
for sale: if so, it is a much earlier
occurrence of the verb than Skeat
records. The above passage would
appear to refer to the letting at
ferm of the fines paid for hawking,
i.e.‚ part of the fines ‘pro licentia
mercandizandi' (licences to traffic).

HELvNG‚ 178. This is from the AS.
verb ‘helan,' lo coven- it is here

coverlet was called a bed-healt'ng in
Derbyshire, and in some other
parts a ‘healing' absolutely: in
Oxsordshire it was used for the
bedclothes; see quotation
