426 RECORDS OF THE BOROUGH OF NOTTINGHAM. [1406

11.-L2·st of Mayors, Slzerzffs, Bailzffs, etc.
” 1399-1485-

 

This List has been compiled upon the principles stated in vol. i., page 422. Most of the
names of the Chamberlains are here supplied from No. 4540, a sheet os paper in the hand-
writing of William Easingwold, which contains on one side notes os presentments in each
year by the Mickletorn Jury from 1440 to 1457¹ of the occupation by Richard Samon of a
piece of the common land near the Trent‚ and upon the other side notices of the payment
of rent sor this land year by year from 1458 to 14883 these are taken srom the Chamber-
lains’ Accounts and give the Chamberlains' names for this period. Several of the names of
the Mayors have been supplied from a list of Mayors in Greaves papers (4770, page 3 sqq.),
which begins in 1410. Greaves only gives the names of the Mayors. Names inserted in
the following List solely upon Greaves’ authority are distinguished by an asteris-k (ᾗ). The
numbers of Burgesses enrolled in different years have also been derived from Greaves.
The preposition ‘de’ in personal names was rapidly dropping out of use in the early part
of this century. Sometimes the names in this List occur with and sometimes without this
adjunct: in these cases ‘ de’ is printed in parentheses.

¹ Richard Samon died in this year.
There is a note in the above pape1: ‘ Item
idem Ricardus obiit xviij. die Decembris,
anno Domini 151¹CCCCLVIIO et anno regni
Regis Henrici Sexti [xxxvj.]' (zalso the
same Richard died on the 18th day of
December, in the year of our Lord 1457
and in the [36th] year of the reign of King
Henry the Sixth). His widow Elizabeth,
rented, after his death, the piece of land
above referred to.

Ξ lllotzastz'con, vi. 180.

3 Thomas Stanley appears to have died
or resigned during the year of his Mayor-
alty. His name occurs in the Court Rolls
as Mayor from Michaelmas 1403 to June 4,

1404 (1301, ro. 18), but at the next Court,
holden June 18, 1404, his name is replaced
by that of Robert Glade, (M, ro. 19).

⁴ The name of William Coser occurs
in one instance only as Bailiff (1303,
ro. 17d.). It is clear that this is another
name of XVrastlingworth, for he is called
by the latter name before and after the
date of the occurrence of the name Coser
as Bailiff.

5 Thomas Deyne appears to have died
or resigned during his year of office. He
is mentioned as Bailiff in the Court Rolls
on December 30, 1405 (1303, ro. 7), being
replaced by Robert Chesterfield at the next
Court, January 13, 1405ιὸ ([ιί., ro. 8).
