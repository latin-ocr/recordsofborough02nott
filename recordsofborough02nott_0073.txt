of iron to do divers works with the said iron, and the said iron was
to be returned to him uninjurcd so soon as the work of the said
Richard should be done3 thereupon the said Richard did not return
the said gad complete to him but broken, to wit, half of the said
iron; and he unjustly detained, and to this time detains from him
the other half3 to the damage of the said Henry of los.; wherefore
he brings suit, etc. And the aforesaid Richard comes, and defends
the damages aforesaid and whatsoever has been unjustly charged
upon him; and he says it does not behove him to answer to the plea
aforesaid; because he says, that at the time and year of the loan of
the aforesaid gad of iron our Lord King Henry aforesaid was present
in this town of Nottingham, and caused to be repaired a place of
battle for his champions to combat in;2 for the separation of which
place the Knight Marshal of our Lord the King, by name Oliver
Mawlyvere, ordered and compelled‚ on behalf of our Lord the King,
william de Darley and Robert de Ockley‚ then Bailiffs of Notting-
ham, and all their servants’ sub-bailiffs to provide, arrange for, and
ordain sufficient instruments wherewith to make holes in the ground
for fixing the timbers and barriers3 round the aforesaid place, until
the aforesaid place should be properly finished, by which Bailiffs and
sub-bailiffs‚ once by the aforesaid Oliver‚ Knight Marshal, the afore-
said Richard was ordered, under pain of loss of his life and memberS,
to arrange for making the said holes; by virtue of which order
and command the said Richard took the said iron for the use of our
Lord the King, and delivered it to the aforesaid Knight Marshal
for the use of our Lord the King: wherefore the said Richard says
that, whereas he fulfilled the mandate of our Lord the King in this
manner, he does not think that he should answer to the aforesaid
Henry for this plea, but should be entirely discharged; and this he
puts in judgment. And the said Henry comes; and says, that the
aforesaid Richard in borrowing the said iron did not inform him of
any work of our Lord the King‚ nor other mandate or precept from

strenuously prosecutcd his¹ appcal and that
Usane had valiantly defended himself.
