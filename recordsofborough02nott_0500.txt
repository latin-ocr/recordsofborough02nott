'l'stvLL‚ 365 bis, 366, 371, 372, The
meaning of this word is clearly
underwood or brushwood‚ small
branches, etc.‚ from trees. It is a
very rare word in the printed glos-
saries, occurring in the Old Counlry
and Farming [Vm-ds, E.D.S., p. 45,
as being formerly used in Derby-
shire for brushwood sor fencing.
[‘Tyn' is clearly O.N. ‘tein‚' ex-
plained by Grimm, Deulsclze My-
thologz’e, p. 1156, as a severed
branch of a tree3 represented by
AS. ‘tan,' corrupted into ‘toe' in
‘ mistletoe,' upon which see Grimm,
and Skeat. For the use of ‘zein'
(=‘tein’) in the German local
dialects see Leo, p. 301: and es-
pecially its use in Bavaria in the
sense given above to ⁶ tynsyll.' The
primary meaning is in every case
‘twig’ or ‘shoot.⁷ ‘Sill' in Scot- Ι
land had the meaning of a billet of
wood or a faggot3 see quotations in
Jamieson‚ av. ‘sil.⁷ This appears
to be the second part of the word

‘ tynsyll‚' which is thus a reduplicated
word]
