vi PREFACE.

there are still many dark periods in our national and political
history that can only be illuminated by the aid of local
records. In the fore-front of these stand the records of our
ancient cities ancl boroughs. The Corporation of London

interesting volume under the able editorship of the late
Mr. Riley. Still, nothing has as yet been done in England
towards the systematic publication of town records. This
consideration partly moved the Town Council of Nottingham
to undertake the present work. The Council feel assured
that other Councils will ere long be led to examine their
unexplored treasures. They believe that a systematic and
careful scrutiny and publication of this class of records will

many problems in English history. The Reports of the
Royal Commission upon Historical MSS. have shown what
riches lie buried in unsuspected quarters. No one can
possibly estimate the value of the matter hidden in the
records of the towns of this country, or the light their
publication would throw, not only upon the national and

scarcely less important subjects of manners and custoinSâ€š
trades and occupations, and the philology of the English
tongue. In short, it may be affirmed that a complete con-

that made Old England, without the aid of the records of
our ancient cities and towns.

Acting upon suggestions of the reviewers of the first

volume, the Council have authorised a more liberal supply of
