XVRONGLANDEQ in Lyngdale‚ 412,
4173 Wronglandes in vol. i. Jacobs,
Lazo Dz'clzbnary, cites Kitchen's
suggestion that wronglands ‘seem
10 1)0 ill-grown trees that will never
prove timber 3 such as wrong the
ground they grow in.' This fanciful
explanation does not apply to
the Wronglandes above indexed.
‘ Lands' has here the meaning still
borne in this County, that is, the
ridges of land between the furrows
or balks in a ploughed field, the
selienes of the Latin records. Cf.
Evan's Leicestersln‘re Glossary‚
E.D.S., p. 183. ‘Wrong' means
wrung out of shape, bent, erooked
(O.N. ‘rangrg' Prompt., p. 534,
wronge, curvus, oblongus; and see
Skeat, xvv. ‘wrench,' ‘wring‚'
‘wrong' The modern meaning of
wrong is derived metaphorically
from this ; cf. Latin curvum, French
tort). Hence the wronglands mean
the ridges that are ploughed awry
or in a bent shape3 perhaps identical
with the ‘linches' of the south
(Seebohm‚ p. 5), derived by Leo,
p. 210, from a lost AS. verb ’111111-
can,' to be troisted, bent. Cf. C.l).‚
