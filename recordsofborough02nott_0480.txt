derived by Skeat from AS. ‘on-efen.’

ANNUS, DIES, VAs‘rus ET STREPPUM,
4, 6. In cases of Petit Treason and
felony the King had, in addition to
the forfeiture of the felon's chattels‚
the profits for a year and a day of
the offender’s lands and tenements.
The King entered the lands and
tenements for this period and had,
by his prerogative, the right of
committing waste, that is to destroy
the houses, plough up the meadows
and pastures, chop down and sel]
the trees, etc., and the additional
right of estrepment (slreppum),
which means more especially the
impoverishment of the ground by
continual ploughing without manur-
ing it. After the expiration of the
year and day the lands and tene-
ments reverted to the lord of the
fee as his escheat. It, however,
early became the practice for the
lord of the see to compound with
the King for this right of year, day

APPRUARE SE, 8. This means prim-

apprower3' Godefroy), from O.Fr.
‘prou,' ‘prewj a word that occurs
very frequently in the Year Books
and is met with in Wicliffe⁷s English
works, but as a law term it acquired
more particularly the meaning of
enclosing waste lands, etc, by the
lords of the manor, who were said
‘to approve themselves’ of the
waste. See Stat„ 20 Ed. Ι.,

ARRAINIARE, 4, Arrainare, 34. To in-
stitute an assize. It is a question
whether this should not be written
‘arram-,⁷ as in the printed texts of
Bracton and the Regzlctmm Brevium.
On the other hand we have the
authority of Coke, and Fitzherbert,
Natura Brew'um, who constantly
writes ‘arrainiare' as above3 whilst
in the printed Fleta it appears as
armanore. It is difficult, however,
to resist the conclusion that this
word is derived from the O.Fr.
‘aramir' upon perusing Godefroy’s
quotations and his suggestion that
it is derived from the Poitevin
‘arramir‚' to conduct, direct, a
meaning so exactly that of ‘arram-
are’ or ‘arrainiare in English law.
Cf. Duc„ av. ‘adramire.' In the
Appendix, p. 516, to the year Book,
32 Ed. Ι., arramare is used in
reference to the productiori of his
suit (secta) by the plaintiff.
