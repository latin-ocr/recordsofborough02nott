xviii INTRODUCTION.

appear at the junctions of the roofs in Sandby’s drawing are plainly
shown projecting through the front of the restored building. The
principa] roos is shown with hipped ends like the present roos of this
building‚ which is a plain modern king-post roos, probably erected
during the alterations to the Hall in 1791, when it assumed its
present uninteresting appearance.1

The original of the view of the Town Hall in 1741 is a pen
and inl< drawing in the possession of the Corporation of Notting-
ham, now preserved at the Art Museum, Nottingham Castle. This
drawing was clearly intended to be engraved. There is a hole in it
on the right hand side over the steps; this is left blank in the plate.
The explanations of the letters in this view agree with Deering’s
account, so sar as it goes. It will be noticed that no explanation of
‘f’ is given. It is clearly, like ‘c,' the ancient gaol for debtors. At
the opening ‘e’ is portrayed a turner in wood. He is using the old
‘pole' or ‘dead-centre’ lathe, which was the general form of lathe in
use in the last century. It is now almost entirely out of use in this
country. In this lathe the piece of wood required to be turned is
secured between two centres fixed in two moveable pieces of wood
known as ‘puppets' or ‘poppets’ The ‘puppets' are fastened at
the distance from each other required by the size of the work in
hand. XVhen the piece of wood to be turned has been fixed between
the centres a cord is passed round it twice or thrice. One end of
this cord is secured to the treadle of the lathe and the other to the
end of a spring-lath affixed to the ceiling. By pressing the treadle a
rotary motion is imparted by the cord to the piece of wood that it is
desired to turn. XVhen the pressure on the treadle is released the
spring-lath causes the piece of wood to revolve in a contrary direc-
tion. Hence it is only possible to use the cutting tools half the time.
This is the reason this form of lathe has dropped out of use. In the
above drawing the spring—lath is clearly shown over the man's head.

An illustration of this lathe is given in the Encyclopaedz'a Bm‘ttanica,

ninth edition, xiv. 323.
