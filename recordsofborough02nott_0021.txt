INTRODUCTION. XV

Mayoralty Rolls—only one belonging to this period has survived.
It is a small, narrow roll 01 parchment endorsed ‘Rotulus Magni
Turni.'1 It is printed in full in this volume, pp. 4o and 60. The loss
of the other Rolls of this period is deeply to be regretted.

7. We now come to two or three classes of records that have
no representatives 01 the date of the first volume of this work.
The first 01 these are the Sessions Rolls, which are records 01 the
proceedings at the Quarter Sessions before the Justices of the Peaee.
The series of these Rolls of the period of this volume is very
far from complete. The earliest of these Rolls now preserved
(No. 1) dates back to A.D. 1453; the next (No. 1b) is of the year
1467; the third (No. 2), comprising only one presentment, is dated
ΑΒ. 1478; the fourth (No. 3 a) belongs to the year 14S2; the fifth
(No. 31)) to A.D. 1482-3; the last (No. 4) of the series 01 this period
being of the year 1484. These Rolls‚ very amply represented by
the extracts from them printed within, consist of the pres'entments
written on small pieces 01 paper‚ the numerous writs and jury-
panels connected with the cases and 01 pieces 01 parchment con-
taining lists of the fines imposed. There are three sets of present-
ments in a complete Roll; one by the Constables; another by
a jury from the eastern side 01 the town; and the third by a jury
from the western side. The jury from the eastern side 01 the town
undoubtedly represents a jury from the English Borough 01 the
town, and the one from the western side, conversely, a jury from the
Freneh Borough.2 The empanelling 01 a jury from each Borough
was necessitated by the different customs prevailing in them, and,
in addition, there appears to have been a different scale 01 fines
for offences in the two Boroughs.

8. The Aceounts of the Chamberlains (=Treasurers)3 of the

Borough are also a series 01 records unrepresented in the first
