effectually suppressed by Montague. We have there notices of the
passage through the town of most of these Lords on their return
from the North, and of payments for clothing soldiers of the town
who rode from Nottingham to the King at York. These soldiers we
learn were clothed in red jackets with white letters sewn upon thern.
There are several records of the visit of Richard of Gloucester to
the town, no doubt during his numerous sojourns at his favourite
residence, the Castle. Other records of minor importance are the
trial by battle fought at Nottingham between two burgesses of
Bordeaux in the presence of King Henry IV. and his sons (including,
no doubt, the subsequent victor of Agincourt and the noble John of
Bedsord), and of Henry's illustrious captive and scholar, the Poet
King of Scotland, James Ι. This duel was fought to decide a cause
that it was held should be referred to the judgment of God, in other
words, to trial by battle. Again, we have the notices of rioting in the
town in 1471, occasioned by the partizans of the triumphant House of
York shortly after the decisivo battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury.
To the const'itutional historian the tribulation caused to the rulers of
the town by the gigantic abuseS, against which so many successive
Statutes of Liveries and Maintenance were aimed‚ will be of interest;

playing at gamcs of chance, which the lawgivers in vain attempted to
suppress in favour of the national pastime of archery, will not be
wholly valueless. Evidence is also forthcoming of the great antiquity
of bellfounding at Nottingham, a foundry so well known to the
students of bells for its great importance. Finally, the numerous in-
ventories of household and other goods, which assist us so materially
in forming an idea of the domestic life of this period, will be most
welcome to the students and compilers of glossaries of Middle
English. The documents in English are also of great value for the
light they shcd upon the dialect of the town in the fifteenth century.
Many rare English words occur in this volume, some of which are
altogether strangers to the printed glossaries.

be somewhat numerous. Most of them are printed in full in this
