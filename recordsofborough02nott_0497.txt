SECTA, 16, 18, et possim. Formcrly
a defendant in a suit was not put
to answer the plaint unless the
plaintiff brought with him into
Court a number of wstnesses, who
were examined, before any issue
was taken, to test the probability of
the plaintiff's demand. If the
evidence of these witnesses dis-
agreed the defendant was excused
from answering. See Bracton‚
lib. iii. tr. 2, c. 37 ,ξ 8 3 Meta, lib. ii.
cap. 633 Bigelow, pp. 256-7, 339,

21-22 Ed. Ι., p. 69: 32-33 Ed. Ι.,

Ed. Ι., pp. 453, 475. This body
of witnesses (‘ testes ') was called
the ‘secta' or suit of the plaintiff.
Hence the plaintiff’s declaration
always concluded with the words
‘et inde producit sectam et dis-
rationationem bonam' (and there-
upon he brings suit and good
proof). Upon ‘disrationatio⁷
(=‘ derein ') see Horwood‚ Intn. to
Year Book, 32-33 Ed. Ι., p. xxxvii.
The production of the suit had
become merely formal by the time
of Edward ΙΙΙ., and afterwards
dropped out of practice, but the
formula was still kept in use. See
