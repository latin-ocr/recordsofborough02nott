had inquired and asked often and earnestly from the said Prior
that, if he knew of or had in his said Priory any documents speaking
or treating of the close, croft or pasture lying within the limits and
bounds of Nottingham or Bassord known as ‘Corner Wong,' he
would deign to show and exhibit them to him: to whose frequent
petitions and importunities the same Prior at last acceding for the
sake of friendship actually showed to the same John Mapperley,
in the year of our Lord one thousand four hundred and eighty, an
indenture1 under the seal of the Lord &Valter of good memory,
sometime Archbishop os York, sealed with the common 5631 of the
town of Nottingham‚ by the tenor of which indenture it manifestly
appeared that the Burgesses and Community of the said town of
Nottingham had and ought to possess common of pasture in the
said close by everlasting right: which indenture and the tenor of the
same the. said John not clearly understanding, 35 he said, earnestly
besought the same Prior that he would deign to deliver it to him and
to lend it to him for a week, or at least for three days, to inspect and
to deliberately examine the sarne, promising faithfully that he would
re-deliver the same safe, sound, whole and uninjured after the lapse of
that time, upon pain of twenty pounds; which indenture is delivered
by the said Prior to the said John Mapperley, and the often-named
John Mapperley, the aforesaid time having elapsed, although often
solicited and lawfully requested on the part of the before-named Prior
to deliver and restore again the aforesaid indenture to the same Prior,
utterly refused, and at the present time refuses, to deliver and restore
it, to the grievous peril of his soul‚ injury of the law, and to the
prejudice and no small damage ancl grievance of all having an
interest in the said close, croft or pasture, and especially of the
Burgesses and (Lommunity of the said town of Nottingham. All and
singular of which premises the same Prior then and there asserted to
have been and to be true, as he would answer before the Most High
Judge at the Day ofJudgment,
