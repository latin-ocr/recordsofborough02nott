xvi INTRODUCTION.

volume; indeed, there is only one account preserved of the period
of this volume: it is printed in full at pages 369 to 380. This
Account is written in a small quarto book of paper in the neat hand-
writing of william Easingwold‚ who was afterwards, and may have
been then, the Mayor’s or Town Clerk. A page or two at the end
of this interesting account has been unfortunately lost; otherwise it
is in very good preservation. It has evidently been in this incomplete
condition for some time, for there is a certificate on page 12, the last
page in good preservation‚ that this book had been produced in the
Exchequer, ΑΒ. 1712, in the case Regina v. the Mayor and Burgesses
of the town of Nottingham and other defendants

9. There are no Accounts of the Bridge-Wardens or Bridge-
Masters preserved of earlier date than 1457-8. The only other one
of this period embraces the years 1458 to 1461. These are accounts
of the moneys received for, and expended upon, the reparation of
the great Hethbeth or Trent Bridge. The sustentation of this
Bridge, which was replaced by the present Trent Bridge a few years
ag0‚ was a great burden upon the town in the Middle Ages. The
Accounts consist of a summary, written in Latin on parchment, of
the receipts and expenditure of the Bridge-Wardens for the time
being. The two summaries are printed within at pages 220 and 244.
In addition to the summary the first of these Accounts comprises
the separate accounts of the expenditure of the two Bridge—Wardens‚
giving full details of every payment. John Spencer's account is
written upon both sides of two foolscap folios, and what is evidently
the account of the other Bridge-XVarden, Robert Stables, is written
upon two and a half folios of foolscap paper sewn together in the
form of a roll. These particulars of expenditure are printed at
p. 364 sqq„ with the omission of the very numerous payments of
wages for employment that is not stated. The parchment summary
and the particulars of expenditure are sewn together at the top, the
parchment forming a cover to the whole when folded up. The
particulars of the second Account are unfortunately lost.
