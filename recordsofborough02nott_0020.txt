xiv INTRonUCTION.

There are no other records of this class preserved between this and
A.D. 1459, when we find that these records have suffered, in the
interval, a change similar to that undergone by the records of the
Borough Court about the same time. They are no longer rolls os
parchment but paper books of the same size (4to.) as the Borough
Court Books. They may be called Mayoralty Books, for they simply
represent the older Mayoralty Rolls in book form. There are three
such books preserved belonging to the period of this volume:
No. 4478, A.D. 1459-6o; No. 3955, A.D. 1463-4; and No. 4494,
A.D. 1467-8. On the first page of No. 4478 is written1 ‘Fines,
Amerciamenta, necnon Catulla Forisfacta, coram Thoma Thurland‚
Majorc villae Notyngham', anno regni Regis Henrici Sexti post
Conquaestum Angliae [tricesimo] octavoz’ this heading is repeated,
with the necessary alterations, in the other two books. These books
contain, like the Mayoralty Rolls‚ the presentments of affrays‚
Assizes of Bread, Sureties to keep the Peace, lists of fines for licence
to traffic, and lists of Burgesses enrolled. Kindred matter is occa-
sionally entered, and even records of two or three suits that should
properly have appeared in the records of the Borough Court. There
is another book, No. 3350, AD. 1478-9, that should be reckoned with
these, as it is substantially one of the same series. It has, however,
for a long period of time been considered as the first of the series of
Hall Books (the minute books of the Town Council), although,
strictly speaking, there is nothing in it or, indeed, in any of the Hall
Books for many years after this date to connect them particularly
with the Town Council. The early Hall Books are clearly the
continuation of the series of Mayoralty Books, which gradually
developed into actual Council Books. The three Mayoralty Books
and this so-called Hall Book are all represented in this volume by
extracts under their respective dates.
